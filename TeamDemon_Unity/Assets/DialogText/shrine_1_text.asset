  - 'Return to the Earth

    Those who were once outcasts of their own flesh

    Deprived
    of rest, forced to wander painfully in their prisons

    Sink back, now, into
    the soil

    Eternal exile overcome

    To become one with what will prevail

    Once
    humanity reaches its end

    The world, once denied, is yours

    In the grave'
