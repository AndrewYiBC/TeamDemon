  - 'Ashes to ashes; dust to dust

    In a Wasteland a sprout such as this is thrust

    Beacon
    of hope, roots of steel

    Standing pretty and tall, you hold up your end of
    the deal

    For eternities you shall grow

    A lighthouse to guide us out
    of this storm

    Dedicated to our ancestors, our descendants and our power

    The
    dream of this tree will not sour'
